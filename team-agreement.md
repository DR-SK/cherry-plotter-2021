### Communication Plan
 
>How will your group communicate with each other? 
 
We will communicate openly and kindly, primarily through Zoom and Slack. 
 
>What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? 
 
We will make scheduled space for structured emotional check-ins: each person has the floor for a full three minutes, during which other members practice actively listening. After three minutes are up, the person who shared may accept or decline questions or responses from listeners. 
 
We’ll also rely on a code stand-up, separate from emotional check-ins, where every team member can take a few minutes to describe how they’re feeling about the tasks they’ve been assigned, what they’re interested in working on over the course of the day, the project in sum, et cetera. 
 
To ensure that everyone’s voice is considered, we will use a consensus-based approach to decision-making. 
 
>Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?
 
Though we feel that our emotional check-ins should address this issue, we will also: 

* practice *validating* rather than placating. If someone talks about something they’re worried about, respond with a validation rather than “that doesn’t seem like a big deal”. 
    
* emphasize a healthy code/rest balance. We will encourage each other to stick to a regular break schedule, and place caring for our bodies and our emotional needs over our project.  

* Katie has volunteered to be the break accountability person. 
 
### Conflict Plan
 
>What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
 
Our conflict plan assumes that everyone is comfortable advocating for themself, and beyond that, is empowered to initiate conversation around conflict with a direct message over Slack, bringing it up in the group, or however feels best and most appropriate to the situation. 
 
If we feel deadlocked at any point, we’ll ask TA’s to come help us talk it through. 
 
### Work Plan
 
>How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on substantial problems. What project management tool will be used?
 
We’ll use Trello for making and assigning tickets (we’ll color code tickets on Trello to see who’s working on what), and for tracking in-progress and completed tasks. We’ll use Miro for whiteboarding and general planning. 
 
This isn’t a competition for most commits. We expect everyone to do their best. 
Take turns, respect each other’s wishes (if you like to drive or not, etc.). We hope that we can mitigate bad experiences by our commitment to open, honest, transparent communication.
 
### Git Process
 
>What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
 
As per the instructions we received today, 
we’ll adhere to the following principles:
* two people must review a pull request before accepting its changes.
* the person who created the commit should be the one to merge the code. 
* merge conflicts should be reviewed as a team.
we will merge whenever we finish a feature. 
 
>Any thing else you feel is important?
 
We feel comfortable fluidly moving between mobbing, pairing or working solo, with communication and check-ins about how the process is feeling.
 
We expect work that happens outside of school hours to be communicated while we’re all together, and reviewed as a group in the morning.
